# Thank you Stephanie

This is a website dedicated to Stephanie and the Google Open Source team who organized Google Code-in as a thank you from the 2018 active winners <3

# How do I add a note?

To add a note create a new file in the `_winners` directory with the following filename: `{first-name}-{last-name}.md`. Copy this base template to it and replace the values with what you want it to say:

```
---
name: Your name. First Name + Last Name
org: Which Org did you participate in?
---

TEXT CONTENT HERE

```
